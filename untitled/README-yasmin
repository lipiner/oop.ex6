=============
The program contains 3 separate packages (all part of the oop.ex6 package):
- main: responsible for the main class that runs the program. contains 2 classes:
  - Sjavac - Contains the main method. This class is responsible for reading the sjava files, and for checking the
    validity of the code using classes from the validity package.
  - InvalidInputException - an exception that is being thrown when the input is invalid.
- validity: this package is responsible for any validity check check or test is being made. The validity check is
  separate to 2 parts:
  - SyntaxChecker - this is a static class that checks the syntax of the code using regex. Its main method (checkLine)
    returns a CommandLine object (as describe below).
  - CommandLine - this class makes the more complex validity test that checks the validity of the command that is not
    related to syntax but to the content of the command, such as the validity of the declaration of variables (whether
    the variable can be declared in the scope), the variable assignment (whether the value consists the variable type),
    the conditions and method blocks (whether the parameters or conditions are valid and it's in the correct outer
    scope), the validity of closing scope (with or without return statement) and etc. This is an abstract class that
    has 9 classes that inheritance from it, each one checks different type of commands. All classes has one public
    command which is common for all CommandLine (check) due to polymorphism so when calling a CommandLine object
    there is no need to know the type of the command but you still can check its validity.
- program_members: this package is responsible for all the members of the Sjava code, such as the variables and members.
  It contains 9 classes:
  - ScopeChecker - this is an abstract class for a scope in the program. It contains some common methods for all the
    scope due to polymorphism. Its main method is readLine that reads the next command line of the scope (the method
    is called by the main class that reads the file). The scope class interacts with the validity package by first
    check the command syntax (using SyntaxChecker), and second check the validity of the command by calling the
    CommandLine check method. The scope also has methods for the commands that available in the scope such as the
    adding variable, assigning an existed variable and close the scope. These methods are called by the CommandLine
    that checks the validity and makes the operation. If the operation is invalid in the specific scope, an exception
    is being thrown.
  - GlobalScope & LocalScope - these are the 2 types of scopes. Each contains its variables and supports the commands
    that are available in the specific type of scope.
  - GlobalMembers - this is a singleton class that contains all the global members (variables and methods signatures)
  - Variable -
  - VariableWrapper -
  - Method -
  - 2 Exception classes -

- Changing the package hierarchy:
- Remove unidentifiedCommand class and related methods from the GlobalScope and the GlobalMembers:
- Adding pattern members:

- Using tools that not discussed in course material: we used the class RandomAccessFile to read the file. We chose
  this class so we could reset the reader to the beginning of the file since we chose to read the file twice (once
  for the global members and methods and then for reader the inner lines of the methods).
