=  Design:  =
=============
The program contains 3 separate packages (all part of the oop.ex6 package):
- main: responsible for the main class that runs the program. contains 2 classes:
  - Sjavac - Contains the main method. This class is responsible for reading the sjava files, and for checking the
    validity of the code using classes from the validity package. The class reads the file twice. During the first
    time it goes through the file, it reads only the global scope so all the global information will be saved, since
    it can be update at any stage in the global scope code but all the inner methods should be familiar with it no
    matter when if it is after or before the method. This subject will discuss more later.
  - InvalidInputException - an exception that is being thrown when the input is invalid.
- validity: this package is responsible for any validity check check or test is being made. The validity check is
  separate to 2 parts:
  - SyntaxChecker - this is a static class that checks the syntax of the code using regex. Its main method (checkLine)
    returns a CommandLine object (as describe below).
  - CommandLine - this class makes the more complex validity test that checks the validity of the command that is not
    related to syntax but to the content of the command, such as the validity of the declaration of variables (whether
    the variable can be declared in the scope), the variable assignment (whether the value consists the variable type),
    the conditions and method blocks (whether the parameters or conditions are valid and it's in the correct outer
    scope), the validity of closing scope (with or without return statement) and etc. This is an abstract class that
    has 9 classes that inheritance from it, each one checks different type of commands. All classes has one public
    command which is common for all CommandLine (check) due to polymorphism so when calling a CommandLine object
    there is no need to know the type of the command but you still can check its validity.
- program_members: this package is responsible for all the members of the Sjava code, such as the variables and members.
  It contains 9 classes:
  - ScopeChecker - this is an abstract class for a scope in the program. It contains some common methods for all the
    scope due to polymorphism. Its main method is readLine that reads the next command line of the scope (the method
    is called by the main class that reads the file). The scope class interacts with the validity package by first
    check the command syntax (using SyntaxChecker), and second check the validity of the command by calling the
    CommandLine check method. The scope also has methods for the commands that available in the scope such as the
    adding variable, assigning an existed variable and close the scope. These methods are called by the CommandLine
    that checks the validity and makes the operation. If the operation is invalid in the specific scope, an exception
    is being thrown.
  - GlobalScope & LocalScope - these are the 2 types of scopes. Each contains its variables and supports the commands
    that are available in the specific type of scope (the GlobalScope saves its variable in the GlobalMembers object
    and interacts with it).
  - GlobalMembers - this is a singleton class that contains all the global members (variables and methods signatures).
    This is a singleton since there could be only one global scope in a program and therefore only one object for
    global members. Moreover, the global members should be accessible for the CommandLine objects and for all the
    scopes so we made it as a singleton that can be accessed and modified from any part of the program. The class also
    saves the line number of the file while reading so it would be easy to access the line number and save it in the
    method object. The GlobalMembers is being update during the first reading of the file when the global part is being
    read.
  - Variable - a variable object. It saves the code's variable information (such as its name and type).
  - VariableWrapper - a wrapper object for a variable. Since the assigning status is relevant only for the current
    scope and its inner sub scopes, the assigning operation is more relevant to the scope than the variable (since
    we would like to assign the variable only in the current). For that reason we wrapped the variable with a wrapper
    that contains the actual variable and its assigning status. Whenever a variable is being assigned, the scope will
    create a new wrapper (unless it is already a variable that was open and exists in the scope) for its own and assign
    this VariableWrapper object.
  - Method - a method object. It saves the code's method signature (its name and the parameters it gets), and also
    the line number of the method declaration in the file, and its super scope, so when reading the methods codes
    part, we could jump to the method line number without processing other lines, and then the method could open its
    relevant scope in its outer scope.
  - 2 Exception classes - will be discussed in the exceptions part in the answers to questions section.

============================
=  Implementation Issues:  =
============================
Dealing with the disorder in the global scope: as described before we went through the code file twice, once for
process only the global scope, and second for process only the methods, due to the face that variables and methods
that are being accessed in the method can be declared only later in the code, after reading a command line that refers
to it. This can caused an error since the method doesn't familiar with the variable or method. To solve this subject
we found 2 options: either read the file twice as describe above, or save every unresolved command while reading the
file in the first time, and after reading the whole code, check these unresolved commands again.
Each solution has advantages and disadvantages. Reading the file twice may cause problem while connecting to the file
for long time and is not efficient in run time. On the other hand the other solution may be complex and cause some
problems while implementing (since it has to save in each scope and line in the scope the command was to make sure
that any other affected commands are fine, and it also has to call a closed scope which may be cause problems), and it
is not efficient in memory (since it can saves a lot commands). It also can be not efficient as the first solution,
if all the commands will be unresolved and have to be read twice.
Finally, since we had no time or memory demands we chose the more memory efficient
solution and we implemented the fist solution.

==================
=  UML changes:  =
==================
- Changing the package hierarchy: we decided to change the package hierarchy so it will make more sense. We combined
  all the validity classes together, since there is no much difference between the SyntaxChecker and the CommandLine
  in their purpose, and it makes more sense that the SyntaxChecker will be part of a package. This structure of
  packages also allows the CommandLine objects constructor to be with lower modifier (package-private instead of
  public). Another change was to separate the program_members classes from the validity class it was since it doesn't
  really check the validity but contains details about the current members of the program.
- Remove unidentifiedCommand class and related methods from the GlobalScope and the GlobalMembers: as described above
  we faced 2 options to deal with the disorder in the global scope. First we chose the second option that is described
  in the Implementation issues since we thought it is more efficient. When we realized it can be complex and not
  efficient in memory and even in time, we decided to switch the first option and removed these related classes
  and methods.
- Adding pattern members: we add an initializer method in the SyntaxChecker class (createPatterns) that first when
  running the program, creates all the patterns that are needed for the regex and saves them as static members of
  the class. That way the patterns will be complied only once and will they will be reused. Since these patterns
  are needed often and this operation is heavy, this is the more efficient that way.

===========================
- Using tools that not discussed in course material: we used the class RandomAccessFile to read the file. We chose
  this class so we could reset the reader to the beginning of the file since we chose to read the file twice (once
  for the global members and methods and then for reader the inner lines of the methods).
